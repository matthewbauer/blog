#+title: Portable Packaging in Nix

One of the goals of Nixpkgs is to ensure that packages are portable.
This means that when a package builds on an Intel64 Linux machine
should be buildable on Intel32 Linux, ARM Linux, and even macOS
machines (in fact, any machine should work, provided a valid standard
environment). Issues in various packages come up to make this
difficult but we try to make things as consistent as possible. This is
in sharp contrast to macOS-specific package managers like
Homebrew[fn:1] and almost all Linux package managers.

Like most Linux distributions, NixOS uses GNU software for much of its
userland. This tradition of GNU/Linux[fn:2] means that most Linux
software will only build with GNU tools.

Let’s look at the packages guaranteed to be in a standard environment
within Nixpkgs. These are some of the few packages that you can assume
exist in Nixpkgs without listing them explicitly. Because these
“common paths” are required to bootstrap the standard environment
completely, we can safely assume that they will always be available in
Nixpkgs.

The tools in the standard environment have a long history dating back
to the original version of Unix (1975)[fn:3]. While Nix

| Standard C++ Library | libstdc++    | libstdc++    | libc++            | MSVCP           |   |

Traditionally, the GNU project’s Glibc has been assumed in NixOS.
Glibc provides us with a standard C library, but is very closely
coupled with Linux. In fact, Glibc will not run on macOS at all. Many
incompatibilities will naturally exist between libSystem and Glibc.
For instance, both Glibc and libSystem provides a number of built-in
“bonus libraries” that are always available.

** FAQs
*** What to do when a package really does need GCC?

    Not all packages are portable. In these cases we have a way to
    ensure that GCC is used as the compiler. For example, the tool
    "masscan" will only build with GCC.

    #+begin_src nix
    masscan = callPackage ../tools/security/masscan {
      stdenv = gccStdenv;
    };
    #+end_src

    gccStdenv will ensure that our standard environment uses GCC
    instead of the default (which will depend on what platform you
    use). Likewise if you’re package requires Clang to build, you can
    do the same.

    #+begin_src nix
    afl = callPackage ../tools/security/afl {
      stdenv = clangStdenv;
    };
    #+end_src
